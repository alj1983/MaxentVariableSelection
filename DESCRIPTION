Description: Complex niche models show low performance in identifying
    the most important range-limiting environmental variables and in
    transferring habitat suitability to novel environmental conditions
    (Warren and Seifert, 2011; Warren et al., 2014). This package helps to
    identify the most important set of uncorrelated variables and to
    fine-tune Maxent's regularization multiplier. In combination, this
    allows to constrain complexity and increase perforance of Maxent niche
    models (assessed by information criteria, such as AICc (Akaike, 1974) ,
    and by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC)
    (Fielding and Bell, 1997). Users of this package should be familiar with
    MAXENT niche modelling.
