## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have corrected the vignette.

## R CMD check results
* There was one WARNING

checking package vignettes in ‘inst/doc’ ... WARNING
Package vignette without corresponding PDF/HTML:

The pdf and html files are included in inst/doc


* There was one NOTE
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
