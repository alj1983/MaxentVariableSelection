## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have corrected the vignette
and added DOIs to the references in the description, as
requested. Also added example code in the example section of the
VariableSelection.Rd file as requested.

## Test environments
* ubuntu 16.04, R 3.2.3

## R CMD check results

* There was one NOTE
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  AICc (17:55)
  Maxent (4:56, 16:64, 20:5)
  Maxent's (15:15)
  Seifert (13:17)
  al (13:42)
  et (13:39)

All words are spelled correctly.
